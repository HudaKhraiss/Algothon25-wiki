Following the success of our 2020 Algothon, the very first student-led algorithmic trading hackathon in Australia, we're keen to be back bigger and better than last year!

We're making this page available for you to gain access to our Algothon Guidelines, learning resources and technical advice, which will hopefully assist you in the competition. More information regarding the Algothon objectives, schedule and prizes will be made available in the lead-up to our competition start date.
