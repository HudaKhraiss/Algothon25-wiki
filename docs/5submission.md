# Submission

Submission link will be made available after case release.

‚è∞ [**SUBMISSIONS NOW DUE 12:00PM AEST 14 JULY]**


### Preliminary

Your submission must include:

- Team name.
- Team captain name and email.
- Link to public GitHub repo, containing your source code in a file titled *[team_name].py.*
    - This file will contain your algorithm, containing function *getMyPosition().*
    - Your function must take in the data provided in *prices.csv.*
    - Your function must output a vector of integers, each denoting your daily position.
- 1 minute video, briefly explaining your algorithm and what strategies you employed.
    - Team members are not *required* to be in the video - voiceovers will suffice.
- A list of libraries used, if not included in Anaconda installation.
- Any other supporting documentation.

At case launch, we will provide our autotesting file, *eval.py*. Ensure you run your program against the test before submission. We expect algorithms to have a maximum runtime of ~10min.

Note that your algorithm will be assessed on future, unseen price data from the same trading universe. 

üìå The submission form will be made available [**here**](https://forms.gle/G834jUMnygwaMDCw7) at case release, and will close promptly at **9:00AM AEST 14 July**.


### Finals

If your team is successful in progressing to the final round, you will be provided the data used to evaluate your algorithm in the preliminary rounds.

Final round submissions are due **2:00PM AEST 20 July.** 

Submissions must include:

- Team name.
- Team captain name and email.
- Link to public GitHub repo, containing your code in a file titled *[team_name].py.*
    - This file will contain your algorithm, containing function *getMyPosition().*
    - Your function must take in the data provided in *prices.txt.*
    - Your function must output a vector of integers, each denoting your daily position.
- A list of libraries used, if not included in Anaconda installation.
- Slide deck consisting of up to 10 slides (excluding appendix).
    - Background on trading strategy and what techniques have been used.
    - Algorithm development and any assumptions used.
    - Analysis performed on given price data.
    - Developed optimisations.

Note that final round presentations will consist of a *5 minute presentation*, alongside *4 minutes* of Q&A.

Final submissions will be also quantitatively assessed, with test results provided to judges prior to team presentation.
